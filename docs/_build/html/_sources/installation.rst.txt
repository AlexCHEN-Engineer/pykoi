Getting Started
===================================

**pyKoi** is an open-source data curation platform for LLMs. Using pyKoi,
everyone can build robust language models through faster data curation using
both human and machine feedback. We provide support for each step in the MLOps
cycle, from data labeling, model monitoring, to RLHF.
